title: "AWS ECS using Stacktape"
description: "This configuration file outlines the deployment process for any containerized application using AWS ECS and Stacktape. The application is designed to serve as a demonstration of deploying a scalable web service using container technology."

Step 1: Set Up AWS Account

1.If you haven't already, create an AWS account.
2.Configure your AWS CLI with your access credentials. You can install AWS CLI by following the instructions in the AWS documentation.


Step 2: Install Stacktape

1.Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
2.Install Stacktape globally using npm:
   ```npm install -g stacktape```


Step 3: Prepare Your Application

1.Organize your application code and Dockerfile.
2.Make sure your application is containerized using Docker.


Step 4: Create a Stacktape Configuration File

In your application's root directory, create a stacktape.yml or stacktape.json configuration file. Below is an example of a stacktape.yml file:

```
name: my-ecs-app
version: 1.0.0

stages:
  production:
    aws:
      region: us-east-1
    cloudFormation:
      stackName: my-ecs-app-production

    api:
      events:
        - http:
            path: /
            method: ANY

    containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: path-to-your-docker-image
        memory: 512
        portMappings:
          - containerPort: 80
            hostPort: 80
```
Customize the configuration to match your application's needs.


Step 5: Deploy Your Application

1.Open a terminal and navigate to your application's directory.
2.Run the following command to deploy your application:
   ```stacktape deploy production```
   This command will create the necessary AWS resources, such as ECS clusters, services, and tasks, to host your application.


Step 6: Monitor and Scale Your Application

1.After deployment, Stacktape will provide you with URLs to access your application.
2.Monitor your application's performance using AWS CloudWatch or other monitoring tools.
3.To scale your application, adjust the containers section in your stacktape.yml configuration file, and then redeploy using the stacktape deploy command.


Step 7: Cleanup

If you want to remove all the resources created by Stacktape, you can run:
```stacktape remove production```
